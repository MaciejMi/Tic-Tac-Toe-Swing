# Tic Tac Toe in Java Swing

Tic Tac Toe is a classic two-player game where opponents take turns marking an empty 3x3 grid with their
respective symbols â€“ X and O. The goal is to achieve a row, column, or diagonal of three of the same symbols,
signaling victory. A simple yet engaging strategic challenge for players of all ages.
